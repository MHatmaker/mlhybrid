You can also deploy to an android device connected to your local WiFi network.
On most custom ROMs wifi adb is already built in and can be added to Quick Settings menu.
It can also be enabled via Settings > Developer options ADB over network.
If you don't have the corresponding option then you can use a third party app which will
let you turn it on and off. See e.g. https://play.google.com/store/search?q=wifi%20adb53

Once you enabled ADB over wifi on the phone note down its IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.123), and then from terminal run:

adb connect 192.168.1.123
Now you can deploy directly to your phone without a cable:

ionic run android
